# ta408n
Compact, simple Volume &amp; Balance control

## Purpose
This is intended to be placed between an _Input Selection board_ like [TuchAudio 509](../../../ta509) and a _power amp_ stage, like a couple of [TuchAudio 209](../../../ta209) boards. This is the recommended configuration as in the [TuchAudio 309](../../../ta309) _Integrated Amplifier_ .

Being a **totally passive** circuit, it might be used with almost any other configuration, like the [501](../../../ta501) board.

### Options and improvements
A possible upgrade would be the [TuchAudio 409n](../../../ta409n) board, which replaces the _balance_ control for a _switchable_ **tone control** (Baxandall-type).
