Compact, simple Volume &amp; Balance control

## Purpose
This is intended to be placed between an _Input Selection board_ like **TuchAudio 509** and a _power amp_ stage, like a couple of **TuchAudio 209**s. This is the recommended configuration as in the _Integrated Amplifier_ **TuchAudio 309**.

Being a **totally passive** circuit, it might be used with almost any other configuration, like the `501` board.

### Options and improvements
A possible upgrade would be the **TuchAudio 409n** board, which replaces the _balance_ control for a _switchable_ **tone control** (Baxandall-type).
